# Corrected Customer Architecture - Brand-Specific Experience

## 🎯 **Actual Backend Architecture**

Your current flow is **brand-centric**, not customer-centric:

```
BRAND FLOW:
1. Brand creates custom domain (e.g., ecofashion.ordira.com)
2. Brand designs their voting page frontend
3. Brand adds their proposals
4. Brand makes page public
5. Customers visit BRAND'S domain directly
6. Customers sign up with email (email gating)
7. Customers vote (1 vote per email per brand)
8. Customers get certificates from that specific brand
```

## 📁 **Corrected Customer Structure**

```
(customer)/
├── [brand-domain]/              # Dynamic brand domains
│   ├── gate/                    # Email gating for this brand
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── proposals/               # Brand's voting proposals
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── vote/                    # Voting interface for this brand
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── certificate/             # Brand-specific certificates
│   │   └── [id]/
│   │       └── page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx               # Brand-specific layout
│   └── loading.tsx              # Brand-specific loading
├── layout.tsx                   # Root customer layout
└── loading.tsx                  # Global customer loading
```

## 🎯 **What This Means:**

### **1. No Customer Dashboard**
- Customers don't have a personal dashboard
- Customers only interact through brand pages
- Each brand has their own customer experience

### **2. Brand-Specific Experience**
- Each brand domain has its own voting page
- Brand-specific theming and customization
- Brand-specific email gating
- Brand-specific certificates

### **3. Email Gating Per Brand**
- Customers sign up with email per brand
- 1 vote per email per brand
- Brand-specific customer database
- No cross-brand customer data

### **4. Certificate Management**
- Certificates are brand-specific
- No cross-brand certificate collection
- Certificates are verified per brand
- Brand-specific certificate display

## 🔧 **Implementation Strategy**

### **Option 1: Dynamic Brand Routing (Recommended)**
```
(customer)/
├── [brand]/                     # Dynamic brand slug
│   ├── gate/page.tsx           # Brand-specific gate
│   ├── proposals/page.tsx      # Brand's proposals
│   ├── vote/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx          # Brand-specific voting
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── certificate/[id]/page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx              # Brand-specific layout
│   └── loading.tsx
├── layout.tsx                  # Root layout
└── loading.tsx
```

### **Option 2: Subdomain Routing**
```
(customer)/
├── gate/page.tsx               # Global gate (redirects to brand)
├── proposals/page.tsx          # Global proposals (brand-aware)
├── vote/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
├── certificate/[id]/page.tsx
├── layout.tsx                  # Brand-aware layout
└── loading.tsx
```

## 🎨 **Brand-Specific Features**

### **1. Dynamic Theming**
- Brand colors and logos
- Brand-specific messaging
- Brand-specific voting rules
- Brand-specific certificate design

### **2. Email Gating**
- Brand-specific email allowlists
- Brand-specific customer database
- Brand-specific voting permissions
- Brand-specific notification settings

### **3. Voting Experience**
- Brand-specific voting interface
- Brand-specific proposal display
- Brand-specific voting rules
- Brand-specific results display

### **4. Certificate System**
- Brand-specific certificate design
- Brand-specific verification
- Brand-specific achievement system
- Brand-specific sharing options

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Remove customer dashboard** - Not needed for your architecture
2. **Implement brand-specific routing** - Dynamic brand domains
3. **Create brand-aware layouts** - Each brand gets custom theming
4. **Implement email gating** - Per brand customer management
5. **Build voting interface** - Brand-specific voting experience

## ✅ **Corrected Understanding**

Your architecture is **brand-centric**, not customer-centric:
- Brands create their own voting experiences
- Customers interact through brand pages
- No unified customer dashboard
- Brand-specific everything (theming, gating, certificates)

This is actually **better** for your use case because:
- Brands have full control over their experience
- Customers get brand-specific experiences
- Simpler architecture
- Better brand differentiation
- Easier to implement and maintain

## 🎯 **Final Recommendation**

**Keep your current structure** but make it brand-specific:
- Remove the customer dashboard
- Implement dynamic brand routing
- Create brand-aware layouts
- Focus on brand-specific experiences
- Implement email gating per brand

This matches your backend architecture perfectly! 🎉
