/**
 * @deprecated This file has been migrated to services/infrastructure/types/declarations/multer.d.ts
 * 
 * TypeScript automatically includes .d.ts files from all included paths,
 * so the new location in infrastructure/types/declarations/ is already active.
 * 
 * This file is kept for reference but the actual declarations are now in:
 * services/infrastructure/types/declarations/multer.d.ts
 * 
 * For importing MulterError class, use:
 * import { MulterError } from 'services/infrastructure/types/declarations';

// Global declarations and types are now in infrastructure/types/declarations/
// TypeScript automatically picks up .d.ts files from src/**/* paths
